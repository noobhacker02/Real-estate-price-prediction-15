Real Estate Pricing
Prediction
Problems faced during buying a house:

1) Buying a house is a stressful thing.

2) Buyers are generally not aware of factors that influence the house prices.

3) Many problems are faced during buying a house.

4) Hence real estate agents are trusted with the communication between buyers and sellers as well as  laying down a legal contract for the transfer. This just creates a middle man and increases the cost of houses.
